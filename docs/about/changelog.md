All notable changes to this project are presented below.

## Unreleased

**✨ Improvements**

- Magic rendering now uses the executor/toolchain pipeline by default for `pdflatex` and `xelatex`.
- Hardened legacy command execution by switching from shell command strings to argument-vector subprocess calls.

**📚 Docs**

- Updated installation and troubleshooting guides to document `latexmk` and toolchain PATH requirements.
- Added notes to the magic usage guide explaining `--tex-program` toolchain mapping and legacy fallback behavior.

## v0.5.6

**✨ Improvements**

- Docs: Added troubleshooting section to the Usage Guide.

## v0.5.5

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Removed quotation marks when using `arg "$var"` (e.g., `-p "$preamble"`).

## v0.5.4

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Docs: Removed the Jinja2 subsection from the README.

## v0.5.3

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Docs: Fixed Jinja section in `installation.md`.

## v0.5.2

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Docs: Fixed internal links in `index.md`.

## v0.5.1

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Docs: Minor fix in changelog.

## v0.5.0

**🚨 Breaking Changes**

- Significant changes to Jinja2 rendering:
    - Replaced the default Jinja2 syntax with a custom one to avoid clashes with LaTeX braces (`{}`). Please refer to the documentation for more details.
    - With the new syntax, conflicts with LaTeX are significantly reduced, thus Jinja2 is now enabled by default and has become a mandatory dependency.
    - Added a `--no-jinja` flag to allow optional disabling of Jinja2 rendering.

## v0.4.2

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Doc: Fixed social cards image links.

## v0.4.1

**✨ Improvements**

- Switched temporary file names to MD5 hashing for deterministic hashes.

**🚀 Features**

- Doc: Support to social cards (Twitter and Facebook OG).

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Fixed indentation in `TexDocument.tikz_code`.
- Fixed docs issues.

## v0.4.0

**🚀 Features**

- Added support for PGFPlots with external data files.
- Introduced a new flag (`-k`) to retain LaTeX temporary files.
- Added support for grayscale output in rasterized mode.
- Introduced new flags `--save-tikz` and `--save-pdf` to save the TikZ and PDF files respectively; `--save-tex` now explicitly saves the full LaTeX document.

**🚨 Breaking Changes**

- Modified the save functionality: Options must now be passed in `TexDocument.run_latex(...)` as `TexDocument.save()` is no longer used.
- LaTeX rendering is now performed in the current folder, moving away from the use of a temporary directory (`tempdir`). This change facilitates access to external files for PGFPlots.

## v0.3.2

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Improved documentation visibility on mobile devices.

## v0.3.1

**🚨 Breaking Changes**

- Changed the `--as-jinja` flag to `--use-jinja`.
- Reworked the API to an object-oriented approach.

## v0.2.1

**🐞 Bug Fixes**

- Minor adjustments in the README and Getting Started Notebook.

## v0.2.0
